أهلاً بك، أنا هنا بصفتي خبير CGI محترف وأستاذ في الاستبدال الذكي للمنتجات. دعنا نحلل هذا التحدي ونيفر تعليمات دقيقة للذكاء الاصطناعي لتحقيق استبدال flawless. --- ### CGI Product Replacement Analysis & Instructions **Role:** Professional CGI Expert & Smart Product Replacement Professor --- ### **1. Image Analysis (Internal Assessment)** **Product Image Analysis:** * **Product Type:** Modern LED Pendant Light / Chandelier. * **Category:** Lighting fixture (specifically a ceiling-mounted luminaire). * **Form Factor:** Multiple interlocking, irregular circular/elliptical rings. * **Materials/Colors:** Predominantly white or warm white integrated LED lighting within the rings. The frame/canopy appears to be a light beige or off-white metallic finish. * **Brand:** Not identifiable. * **Key Features:** Minimalist, contemporary design, emits light directly from the rings, suspended by multiple thin wires from a central ceiling canopy. **Scene Image Analysis:** * **Scene Type:** Grand, opulent interior (likely a palace hall or a very lavish room). * **Key Focal Point (Target for Replacement):** A very large, multi-tiered crystal chandelier with numerous individual candle-like bulbs, hanging prominently from the center of the ornate ceiling. * **Inventory of Products & Elements:** * **Ceiling:** Heavily decorated with a fresco (mural) depicting classical figures and skies, extensive gold leaf detailing, and architectural mouldings/arches. * **Curtains:** Heavy, rich red velvet drapes, pulled back dramatically to frame the central ceiling area. * **Walls:** Ornate gold detailing and possibly dark, rich wall coverings or tapestries visible through the curtain openings. * **Lighting (other than target):** Several wall sconces or smaller chandeliers are faintly visible on the sides within the gilded architectural elements, contributing to the ambient light. * **Foreground:** Large, lush green foliage (likely a tall plant or floral arrangement) partially visible at the bottom, slightly obscuring the base of the main chandelier. * **Overall Ambiance:** Dark, atmospheric, luxurious, historical, predominantly lit by the existing light fixtures, creating a warm, golden glow. --- ### **2. Intelligent Product Replacement Strategy - CGI Generation Instructions for AI** **Objective:** Seamlessly replace the large crystal chandelier in the palace scene with the modern LED pendant light, maintaining scene integrity and achieving photo-realistic results. --- **CGI Generation Instructions:** **`PROMPT_CGI_PRODUCT_REPLACEMENT_V1.0`** "As a highly skilled CGI rendering engine, your task is to perform an intelligent and precise product replacement in the provided scene image. Adhere strictly to the following steps and quality parameters:" --- **Step 1: Product Category Identification & Precise Replacement Location** 1. **Identify Target Category:** From the "Scene Image," identify the large, multi-tiered crystal chandelier located in the absolute center of the ceiling. Confirm its category as a 'central ceiling lighting fixture.' 2. **Product Category Match:** The "Product Image" provided is a modern LED pendant light, which falls under the same 'central ceiling lighting fixture' category. This confirms the replacement is valid. 3. **Define Replacement Location:** The new product MUST be placed in the *exact same 3D coordinates* where the crystal chandelier's primary suspension point is. It must hang from the central ceiling point, not on walls, curtains, or empty spaces. --- **Step 2: Complete Old Product Removal & Inpainting** 1. **Full Removal:** **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** Completely and entirely remove the existing large crystal chandelier from the scene. Ensure *no part* of the old fixture, its suspension wires, or its direct light effects remain. 2. **Seamless Inpainting:** After removal, meticulously perform inpainting to perfectly recreate the underlying ceiling architecture. This includes: * Reconstructing the ornate fresco painting (mural). * Restoring all gold leaf detailing and architectural mouldings. * Ensuring the central suspension point on the ceiling is accurately and naturally integrated into the recreated background, as if no chandelier was ever there. The reconstructed ceiling must blend perfectly with the surrounding ceiling areas. --- **Step 3: New Product Placement & Proportional Sizing** 1. **Exact Position & Orientation:** Place the new modern LED pendant light (from the "Product Image") into the scene. It must be positioned in the *exact same central ceiling location* where the old chandelier was suspended, respecting the original hanging point. 2. **Angle & Perspective Match:** Ensure the new fixture's 3D orientation, camera angle, and perspective are perfectly aligned with the scene's viewpoint, as if it was originally photographed in that spot. 3. **Realistic Sizing:** * Calculate the appropriate size for the new pendant light based on its perceived distance from the camera and the grandeur of the surrounding architectural elements. * The new fixture should visually command the space as the primary central light source, proportionate to the scale of the grand hall. It should not appear too small or overwhelmingly large, but appropriately fill the visual void left by the removed chandelier. Aim for a significant, yet elegant, presence. --- **Step 4: Realistic Illumination & Shadows** 1. **Primary Light Source:** The new LED pendant light is now the *dominant light source* for the central area of the room. Its integrated LEDs emit a cool white light. 2. **Lighting Match:** * **Direction:** The light should primarily emanate from the rings themselves, casting light upwards onto the ornate ceiling and downwards/outwards into the room. * **Intensity:** Adjust the intensity of the emitted light to be realistic for a fixture of this type in a grand, dimly lit room, maintaining the overall opulent and dramatic ambiance of the original scene. The new light should be bright enough to illuminate its surroundings credibly, but not overexpose the scene. * **Color Temperature:** The light emitted by the new product should be a cool white (typical of modern LEDs), realistically altering the color temperature of the illuminated surfaces (ceiling, upper walls, curtains) from the previous warm glow to a cooler, yet still opulent, tone. 3. **Realistic Shadows:** * Generate accurate and realistic shadows cast by the new pendant light onto the ceiling and surrounding architectural elements. * The direction and softness/sharpness of these shadows must be consistent with the new fixture's light emission and the overall ambient light conditions of the scene. --- **Step 5: Scene Integrity & High-Quality Rendering** 1. **Preserve Architecture:** Maintain 100% of the original room's architecture: all walls, ceiling frescoes, gold leaf details, mouldings, arches, and the general structure of the room. NO modifications or alterations to these elements. 2. **Preserve Furnishings & Decor:** Maintain 100% of all other furniture (if any visible), decor elements (e.g., the red velvet curtains, the green foliage in the foreground), and *any other existing light fixtures* (e.g., wall sconces). Do NOT remove, alter, or add any other objects. 3. **Color & Texture Fidelity:** Retain all original colors, textures, and material properties of the scene, except where directly influenced by the new light source's color temperature. 4. **No New Additions:** Absolutely no new products or elements are to be introduced into the scene, beyond the single replacement of the central chandelier. 5. **Output Quality:** The final image must be of exceptionally high quality, achieving complete photo-realism. The new pendant light should appear as if it was naturally part of the original photograph, with seamless integration in terms of perspective, lighting, shadows, and material interaction. The composite image must look indistinguishable from a real photograph. --- "Execute this plan with precision to deliver a stunning and believable CGI product replacement."
